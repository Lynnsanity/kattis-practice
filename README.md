Learning Python
===============

## What is Kattis?

[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) is a website that creates programming challenges in many languages. Users can link repo
accounts or create new accounts on Kattis to track programming problem answers, questions and progress.
This repo was created so I can keep track of my progress in learning python in an organized and efficient manner over time.

## Problems and Solutions

In this repo you will find difficulty levels(based on Kattis levels) and different problems
labeled by their actual problem name.

* Trivial
* Easy
* Medium
* Hard

## Naming of Problem In Progress/Solution

I named the file I would be working on to be either inprogress.py or solution.py if i finished.
